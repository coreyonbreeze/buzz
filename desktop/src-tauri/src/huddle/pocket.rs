//! Pocket TTS engine wrapper around sherpa-onnx's `OfflineTts`.
//!
//! Pocket TTS is a small (~189 MB int8 ONNX) zero-shot voice-cloning TTS
//! model from Kyutai. It runs quickly on CPU via sherpa-onnx, replacing the
//! previous Kokoro-82M engine that also required an espeak-free but
//! lexicon-heavy G2P pipeline (Misaki + CMUdict).

//! ## Engine-module contract (see `huddle::tts`)
//!
//! `pocket.rs` exposes a fixed surface used by `tts.rs`. Mirroring this
//! contract is what lets the TTS pipeline stay engine-agnostic:
//!
//! - `SAMPLE_RATE: u32`             — engine output sample rate in Hz.
//! - `DEFAULT_VOICE: &str`          — default voice name (without extension).
//! - `VOICE_FILE_EXT: &str`         — extension for per-voice files on disk.
//! - `load_text_to_speech(model_dir)`              → `Result<Engine, String>`
//! - `load_voice_style(path)`                      → `Result<VoiceStyle, String>`
//! - `Engine::synth_chunk(&self, text, lang, &VoiceStyle, steps, speed)`
//!   → `Result<Vec<f32>, String>`
//!
//! `lang` and `steps` are accepted for API compatibility with the previous
//! Kokoro engine but are unused — Pocket TTS does its own language ID from
//! the input text and is not a diffusion model (consistency LM, one step).
