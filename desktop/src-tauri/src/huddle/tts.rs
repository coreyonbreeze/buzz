//! Text-to-Speech pipeline for huddle agent voice output.
//!
//! Mental model:
//!
//! ```text
//! caller: pipeline.speak("Hello world. How are you?")
//!   → bounded sync_channel (TEXT_QUEUE_DEPTH = 8)
//!   → tts_worker thread (owns 1 Pocket TTS engine)
//!       1. Preprocess text
//!       2. Split into sentences
//!       3. Synthesize each sentence individually → f32 PCM
//!       4. Apply volume boost + fade in/out to each sentence
//!       5. Append each buffer to a single rodio Player (gapless playback)
//!       6. Wait for player.empty() before accepting next text item
//!   → tts_active = true while playing, false when idle
//!   → cancel flag: player.clear() + drain queue
//! ```
//!
//! Lookahead pipelining: synthesis of sentence N+1 begins immediately after
//! appending sentence N to the Player. Rodio queues buffers and plays them
//! sequentially — synthesis overlaps with playback for near-zero gaps.
//!
//! `tts_active` is an `Arc<AtomicBool>` shared with the STT pipeline so STT
//! can gate microphone input while the agent is speaking.

/// `examples/pocket_onset_probe.rs`), and a linear 0→1 ramp over 192 samples
/// scales those onset samples by ≤50 % for the first ~4 ms. The result was
/// the "first little sound or two is missing" regression heard on
/// 2026-05-18.
///
/// The first sample of Pocket output measures ≈ 0.0018 (≈ −54 dBFS) — well
/// below the threshold at which a DC-jump would be audible as a click — so

    //   - Frame counting is GATED on tts_active — counters only increment
    //     while TTS is playing.
    //   - On TTS session start (false→true transition), all counters and
    //     the window timer are reset. Prevents stale pre-playback speech
    //     from tripping a cancel.
    //   - In production, counting happens after successful Opus decode
    //     (Ok(n) if n > 0). We can't model decode in unit tests, so
    //     on_frame() represents a successfully-decoded audio frame.
    //   - Each remote peer has an independent frame counter.
    //   - Counters use saturating_add (overflow-safe).
    //   - When a peer's counter crosses REMOTE_SPEECH_THRESHOLD, set
    //     tts_cancel = true.
    //   - Counters reset on the 500ms window (Instant-based in production,
    //     on_tick() in tests — logically equivalent).
    //   - Uses Acquire for tts_active reads, Release for tts_cancel writes.
